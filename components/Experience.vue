        <h3>Mynd Consulting - 2 yrs 5 mos</h3>
        <p>
          Mynd Consulting was a great company. It allows me to develop my
          Front-End and UI/UX skills. I have been into this company for almost
          two years and five months. I started to join in 2016 as a Junior Dev
          and I have been to different teams and learned a lot. Mynd was behind
          the official Dr. Oz app, published by Sharecare Inc.

        <h3>Appetiser Pty Ltd - Present</h3>
        <p>
          I improved my skills by joining Appetiser Appsâ€”one of the most leading
          companies in Australia, founded by Michael MacRae and Jamie Shostak. I
          started to grow as a developer since I joined this company by working
          flexibly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I joined this company in 2018 and developed several web applications
          with different teams. Appetiser Apps have generated millions of
          downloads and its clients are worth billions.
